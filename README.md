Website for Robin Walters' Geometric Learning Lab

## Contribution Guide
1. Go to the [repo page](https://github.com/rsfwalters/rsfwalters.github.io) and fork it.
2. Clone your forked repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/rsfwalters.github.io.git
cd rsfwalters.github.io
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
3. Make any changes you want to the forked codebase.  If you are a lab member, you will probably
be modifying `/pages/geometric-learning-lab.html` or `/pages/research.html` or adding assets to `/images`.  Do not modify `index.html` unless Robin tells you to.
4. Check that you have not broken anything by running the following command.  It will open up a browser and show the full website.  
```
http-server -o
```
If you don't want to set up `http-server`, you can simply double click `index.html` in your file manager to open it in a browser.
5. Commit and push your changes.
6. Go back to the repo page and click the banner to create a pull request with your fork.  Fill in an informative title and description of changes.  
7.  Wait patiently for the PR to be approved and merged.  Alternatively, harass Dian or Robin to approve it faster.
